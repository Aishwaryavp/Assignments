    "# # 1. Explain what inheritance is in object-oriented programming and why it is used.\n",
    "# Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a new class (derived or subclass) to inherit properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) from an existing class (base or superclass).\n",
    "# It is used to promote code reuse, establish a hierarchical relationship between classes, and model the \"is-a\" relationship between objects. With inheritance, you can create new classes that inherit the characteristics of existing classes while adding or modifying specific features."

    "# Single Inheritance: In single inheritance, a derived class inherits from a single base class. It is a simpler and more straightforward form of inheritance, common in languages like Python and Java.\n",
    "# Multiple Inheritance: In multiple inheritance, a derived class can inherit from multiple base classes. This allows a class to inherit attributes and behaviors from more than one source. Multiple inheritance can lead to complex class hierarchies and potential conflicts but provides more flexibility.\n",

    "# In Python, the \"protected\" access modifier is denoted by a single underscore before an attribute or method name (e.g., _protected_attribute). It is intended to indicate that an attribute or method should not be accessed directly from outside the class but is still accessible.\n",
    "# Compared to \"private\" (denoted by double underscores) which strongly discourages external access and \"public\" (no underscores) which allows unrestricted access, \"protected\" provides a middle ground where it is expected that attributes and methods are internal to the class but can be accessed if necessary.\n"
